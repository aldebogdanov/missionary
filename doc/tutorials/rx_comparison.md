# Comparison to RxJava (InfoQ guide)

*Note*: Please read the guides for tasks and flows before reading this one.

[RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) is a popular library providing a reactive streams implementation. We're going to walk through some examples from an [InfoQ guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20200807102627/https://www.infoq.com/articles/rxjava-by-example/) to compare an RxJava `Observable` to a missionary flow. To follow along grab the latest version of missionary and

```clj
(require '[missionary.core :as m])
```

A missionary flow's closest RxJava cousin would be a [`Flowable`](https://javadoc.io/doc/io.reactivex.rxjava3/rxjava/latest/io/reactivex/rxjava3/core/Flowable.html) since both have backpressure. We'll be sticking to using `Observable` in this guide since the API is largely the same and the InfoQ guide is built with it.

The first part will try to keep the comparisons as close as possible to the RxJava implementation. The second part will try to show alternative or more idiomatic solutions.

## 1. Staying close
### a) Hello world

The almost simplest example of an Observable is

```java
Observable.just("Hello", "World")
          .subscribe(System.out::println);
```

This builds a stream of 2 statically defined values and the subscribe call registers a method that will consume the produced values. The end result is 2 lines on stdout.

While an `Observable` is [full of methods](https://javadoc.io/doc/io.reactivex.rxjava3/rxjava/latest/io/reactivex/rxjava3/core/Observable.html), a missionary flow has only a few [primitive operators](https://cljdoc.org/d/missionary/missionary/b.17/api/missionary.core) that can fulfill the same demands (note that the core namespace includes the whole missionary API, not just flows, so the actual number of functions/macros is lower than you see in the namespace). The most basic one is the fork named `?>`:

```clj
(m/? (m/reduce (constantly nil) (m/ap (println (m/?> (m/seed ["Hello" "World"]))))))
```

For those who need a refresher:
- `seed` turns a collection into a flow. 
- `?>` forks the execution of the current `ap` block. So `(m/ap (println (m/?> ...)))` will be run once for each value, i.e. `(println "Hello")`, then `(println "World")`. It is literally a fork in the execution path. 
- `ap` returns yet again a flow.
- `reduce` reduces over the flow, returning a task. Since we don't care about the return value in this case we just return nil.
- `?` runs the task.

While there is certainly more functions/macros being called, you'll find that they are completely orthogonal and compose nicely. The end result is a simpler API.

Since this pattern of reducing a flow for a side effect will be present in the few next sections we define a helper macro to cut on the boilerplate a bit:

```clj
(defmacro drain [flow] `(m/? (m/reduce (constantly nil) ~flow)))
```

Now our solution shortens to:

```clj
(drain (m/ap (println (m/?> (m/seed ["Hello" "World"])))))
```

### b) Zip it

The next example zips two `Observable`s.

```java
List<String> words = Arrays.asList("the", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumped", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog");
Observable.from(words)
 .zipWith(Observable.range(1, Integer.MAX_VALUE), 
    (string, count)->String.format("%2d. %s", count, string))
 .subscribe(System.out::println);
```

This outputs

```text
 1. the
 2. quick
 3. brown
 4. fox
 5. jumped
 6. over
 7. the
 8. lazy
 9. dog
```

The new methods are `from`, `zipWith` and `range`.

Missionary has a `zip` function as well. No other new functions are needed:

```clj
(let [words ["the" "quick" "brown" "fox" "jumped" "over" "the" "lazy" "dog"]]
  (drain (m/ap (println (m/?> (m/zip (partial format "%2d. %s")
                                     (m/seed (range 1 100))
                                     (m/seed words)))))))
```

### c) Letters

Next, each character gets its own line:

```java
Observable.from(words)
 .flatMap(word -> Observable.from(word.split("")))
 .zipWith(Observable.range(1, Integer.MAX_VALUE),
   (string, count) -> String.format("%2d. %s", count, string))
 .subscribe(System.out::println);
```

This outputs:

```text
 1. t
 2. h
 3. e
 4. q
 5. u
 6. i
 7. c
 8. k
<...omitted...>
30. l
31. a
32. z
33. y
34. d
35. o
36. g
```

The only new method is `flatMap`.

No new methods are needed for the missionary implementation, we just fork some more:

```clj
(let [words ["the" "quick" "brown" "fox" "jumped" "over" "the" "lazy" "dog"]]
  (drain (m/ap (println (m/?> (m/zip (partial format "%2d. %s")
                                     (m/seed (range 1 100))
                                     (m/ap (m/?> (m/seed (m/?> (m/seed words)))))))))))
```

*Note*: the nested `ap` call is necessary to not fork the whole block. If we had written

```clj
(let [words ["the" "quick" "brown" "fox" "jumped" "over" "the" "lazy" "dog"]]
  (drain (m/ap (println (m/?> (m/zip (partial format "%2d. %s")
                                     (m/seed (range 1 100))
                                     (m/seed (m/?> (m/seed words)))))))))
```

we would get

```text
 1. t
 2. h
 3. e
 1. q
 2. u
 3. i
 4. c
 5. k
 1. b
 2. r
 3. o
 4. w
 5. n
<...omitted...>
```

*Note*: typically a clojure programmer would sooner write

```clj
(let [words ["the" "quick" "brown" "fox" "jumped" "over" "the" "lazy" "dog"]]
  (drain (m/ap (println (m/?> (m/zip (partial format "%2d. %s")
                                     (m/seed (range 1 100))
                                     (m/seed (mapcat seq words))))))))
```

in this case. However that wouldn't be the same as the RxJava code that actually flatmapped over an `Observable`.


### d) Distinct letters

The guide follows by printing only the distinct letters:

```java
Observable.from(words)
 .flatMap(word -> Observable.from(word.split("")))
 .distinct()
 .zipWith(Observable.range(1, Integer.MAX_VALUE),
   (string, count) -> String.format("%2d. %s", count, string))
 .subscribe(System.out::println);
 ```
 
 This outputs:
 
 ```text
 1. t
 2. h
 3. e
 4. q
 5. u
 6. i
 7. c
 8. k
 9. b
10. r
11. o
12. w
13. n
14. f
15. x
16. j
17. m
18. p
19. d
20. v
21. l
22. a
23. z
24. y
25. g
```

One new method, `distinct`, is introduced here.

We will introduce a new function in missionary as well, a much more general one though, `eduction`. It takes a transducer and returns a new flow, transforming the values along the way. We don't need to reimplement distinct for flows but can reuse a generic transducer:

```clj
(let [words ["the" "quick" "brown" "fox" "jumped" "over" "the" "lazy" "dog"]]
  (drain (m/ap (println (m/?> (m/zip (partial format "%2d. %s")
                                     (m/seed (range 1 100))
                                     (->> (m/ap (m/?> (m/seed (m/?> (m/seed words)))))
                                          (m/eduction (distinct)))))))))
```


### e) Sorted distinct letters

To spot the missing letter the guide sorts them:

```java
.flatMap(word -> Observable.from(word.split("")))
 .distinct()
 .sorted()
 .zipWith(Observable.range(1, Integer.MAX_VALUE),
   (string, count) -> String.format("%2d. %s", count, string))
 .subscribe(System.out::println);
```

This outputs:

```text
 1. a
 2. b
 3. c
<...omitted...>
17. q
18. r
19. t
20. u
21. v
22. w
23. x
24. y
25. z
```

1 new method is introduced, `sorted`.

There is no sort function in missionary and there isn't a transducer available either since sorting requires consuming the whole collection. No new functions are needed though, we just need to `reduce` the flow and `seed`it:

```clj
(let [words ["the" "quick" "brown" "fox" "jumped" "over" "the" "lazy" "dog"]]
  (drain (m/ap (println (m/?> (m/zip (partial format "%2d. %s")
                                     (m/seed (range 1 100))
                                     (->> (m/ap (m/?> (m/seed (m/?> (m/seed words)))))
                                          (m/reduce conj (sorted-set)) m/? m/seed)))))))
```

### f) Merge

The next example merges 2 `Observable`s into 1:

```java
private static long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
public static Boolean isSlowTickTime() {
   return (System.currentTimeMillis() - start) % 30_000 >= 15_000;
}
Observable<Long> fast = Observable.interval(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
Observable<Long> slow = Observable.interval(3, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
Observable<Long> clock = Observable.merge(
       slow.filter(tick-> isSlowTickTime()),
       fast.filter(tick-> !isSlowTickTime())
);
clock.subscribe(tick-> System.out.println(new Date()));
Thread.sleep(60_000);
```

The `clock` `Observable` should emit a value every second for 15 seconds, then every 3 seconds for 15 seconds, in a loop. The example output is

```text
Fri Sep 16 03:08:18 BST 2016
Fri Sep 16 03:08:19 BST 2016
Fri Sep 16 03:08:20 BST 2016
Fri Sep 16 03:08:21 BST 2016
Fri Sep 16 03:08:22 BST 2016
Fri Sep 16 03:08:23 BST 2016
Fri Sep 16 03:08:24 BST 2016
Fri Sep 16 03:08:25 BST 2016
Fri Sep 16 03:08:26 BST 2016
Fri Sep 16 03:08:27 BST 2016
Fri Sep 16 03:08:28 BST 2016
Fri Sep 16 03:08:29 BST 2016
Fri Sep 16 03:08:30 BST 2016
Fri Sep 16 03:08:31 BST 2016
Fri Sep 16 03:08:32 BST 2016
Fri Sep 16 03:08:35 BST 2016
Fri Sep 16 03:08:38 BST 2016
Fri Sep 16 03:08:41 BST 2016
Fri Sep 16 03:08:44 BST 2016
```

The new methods are `interval`, `filter` and `merge`.

Missionary has another fork operator, the concurrent fork `?=`. It forks the execution for all values coming in from the flow concurrently. With this new operator, the `sleep` task that sleeps for the given amount of milliseconds and what we learned so far we can build everything we need:

```clj
(let [start (System/currentTimeMillis)]
  (defn is-slow-tick-time [] (-> (System/currentTimeMillis) (- start) (mod 30000) (>= 15000))))
(defn interval [ms]
  (m/ap (m/? (m/sleep (- (m/?> (m/seed (next (iterate (partial + ms) (System/currentTimeMillis)))))
                         (System/currentTimeMillis)) :emit))))
(def fast (interval 1000))
(def slow (interval 3000))
(def clock (m/ap (m/?> (m/?= (m/seed [(m/eduction (filter (fn [_] (is-slow-tick-time))) slow)
                                      (m/eduction (filter (fn [_] (not (is-slow-tick-time)))) fast)])))))
(m/? (m/reduce (fn [_ _] (println (java.util.Date.))) nil (m/eduction (take 20) clock)))
```

*Note*: The RxJava intervals don't backpressure. Depending on your use case you might want to [`relieve`](https://cljdoc.org/d/missionary/missionary/b.18/api/missionary.core#relieve) backpressure as well.

### g) Plug in

The InfoQ example using an `AsyncEmitter` to turn a listener into a cold `Observable` is out of date (not present in RxJava 3). For completeness we will copy it here though. If anyone knows a RxJava3 solution feel free to submit a PR!

```java
SomeFeed<PriceTick> feed = new SomeFeed<>(); 
Observable<PriceTick> obs = 
  Observable.fromEmitter((AsyncEmitter<PriceTick> emitter) -> 
  { 
    SomeListener listener = new SomeListener() { 
      @Override 
      public void priceTick(PriceTick event) { 
        emitter.onNext(event); 
        if (event.isLast()) { 
          emitter.onCompleted(); 
        } 
      } 

      @Override 
      public void error(Throwable e) { 
        emitter.onError(e); 
      } 
    }; 
    feed.register(listener); 
  }, AsyncEmitter.BackpressureMode.BUFFER); 
```

The example shows a `SomeFeed` that can `register` a new `SomeListener` which receives `priceTick` and `error` events and can ask if a `PriceTick` event was the last one via `isLast`. This listener is then converted to an `Observable`.

A flow doesn't provide callbacks that we could use to emit values or signal error/completion. We can achieve something similar by using a queue. We will use a missionary `mbx` (short for mailbox). `(mbx)` returns a mailbox that can be used as a 1-arity function to send a value and as a task to wait for a value.

```clj
(defn feed->flow [feed]
  (let [mbx (m/mbx)]
    (.register feed (reify SomeListener
                      (priceTick [event] (mbx [:val event]) (when (.isLast event) (mbx [:done])))
                      (error [e] (mbx [:err e]))))
    (m/ap (loop [[t v] (m/? mbx)]
            (case t
              :val (if (m/?> (m/seed [true false])) v (recur (m/? mbx)))
              :err (throw e)
              :done (m/?> m/none))))))
```

## 2. Diverging

An interesting style is to think more in terms of functional `eduction`s over a given flow (a.k.a. transducers).

In `1b` we don't strictly need to zip two flows, we're just interested in indexing the entries. This can be more easily achieved with the `map-indexed` transducer:

```clj
(let [words ["the" "quick" "brown" "fox" "jumped" "over" "the" "lazy" "dog"]]
  (drain (m/ap (println (m/?> (->> (m/seed words)
                                   (m/eduction (map-indexed #(format "%2d. %s" (inc %1) %2)))))))))
```

In `1c` we don't need to `flatMap` or double-fork the flow, we can rely on transducers again:

```clj
(let [words ["the" "quick" "brown" "fox" "jumped" "over" "the" "lazy" "dog"]]
  (drain (m/ap (println (m/?> (->> (m/seed words)
                                   (m/eduction (mapcat seq) (map-indexed #(format "%2d. %s" (inc %1) %2)))))))))
```

In `1d` we already used a transducer, so now we just need to plug it in:

```clj
(let [words ["the" "quick" "brown" "fox" "jumped" "over" "the" "lazy" "dog"]]
  (drain (m/ap (println (m/?> (->> (m/seed words)
                                   (m/eduction (mapcat seq) (distinct) (map-indexed #(format "%2d. %s" (inc %1) %2)))))))))
```

In `1e` we have to break out of our pattern a bit since we need to sort the letters:

```clj
(let [words ["the" "quick" "brown" "fox" "jumped" "over" "the" "lazy" "dog"]]
  (drain (m/ap (println (m/?> (->> (m/seed words)
                                   (m/eduction (mapcat seq) (distinct))
                                   (m/reduce conj (sorted-set)) m/? m/seed
                                   (m/eduction (map-indexed #(format "%2d. %s" (inc %1) %2)))))))))
```

The "have to" is a bit strong, no one can stop us from implementing our own sorting transducer!

```clj
(defn tsort []
  (fn [rf]
    (let [b (java.util.ArrayList.)]
      (fn
        ([] (rf))
        ([result]
         (if (.isEmpty b)
           result
           (let [vs (sort (.toArray b)), rt (reduce rf (unreduced result) vs)]
             (.clear b)
             (rf rt))))
        ([result input] (.add b input) result)))))
```

Now we can return to a single transducer solution:

```clj
(let [words ["the" "quick" "brown" "fox" "jumped" "over" "the" "lazy" "dog"]]
  (drain (m/ap (println (m/?> (->> (m/seed words)
                                   (m/eduction (mapcat seq) (distinct) (tsort)
                                               (map-indexed #(format "%2d. %s" (inc %1) %2)))))))))
```

As you can see transducers make the solutions simpler, shorter and easier to reason about.


# Comparison to RxJava (RxJava readme examples)

Let's look at the [RxJava readme](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/blob/ad50bcda192a2e73ad1fc3532ac27362d50dc898/README.md) for some further examples.

> One of the common use cases for RxJava is to run some computation, network request on a background thread and show the results (or error) on the UI thread:

```java
import io.reactivex.rxjava3.schedulers.Schedulers;

Flowable.fromCallable(() -> {
    Thread.sleep(1000); //  imitate expensive computation
    return "Done";
})
  .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
  .observeOn(Schedulers.single())
  .subscribe(System.out::println, Throwable::printStackTrace);

Thread.sleep(2000); // <--- wait for the flow to finish
```

The `subscribeOn` ensures the callable is run on a thread dedicated for IO (blocking) tasks. `observeOn` ensures the value is observed on the single (e.g. UI) thread.

The callable example emits a single value, so we'll use a task in missionary instead:

```clj
(try (m/? (m/via m/blk (Thread/sleep 1000) "Done"))
     (catch Throwable t (.printStackTrace t)))
```

`via` allows running a task on a different `java.util.concurrent.Executor`. The 2 predefined executors are `cpu` for CPU bound tasks and `blk` for IO bound (BLocKing) tasks.


> Processing the numbers 1 to 10 in parallel is a bit more involved:

```java
Flowable.range(1, 10)
  .flatMap(v ->
      Flowable.just(v)
        .subscribeOn(Schedulers.computation())
        .map(w -> w * w)
  )
  .blockingSubscribe(System.out::println);
```

> Alternatively, the `Flowable.parallel()` operator and the `ParallelFlowable` type help achieve the same parallel processing pattern:

```java
Flowable.range(1, 10)
  .parallel()
  .runOn(Schedulers.computation())
  .map(v -> v * v)
  .sequential()
  .blockingSubscribe(System.out::println);
```

Here the goal is to run the `map` computation in parallel.

If we don't care about the order of the results we can fork the flow concurrently:

```clj
(m/? (m/reduce conj (m/ap (let [v (m/?= (m/seed (range 1 11)))] (m/? (m/via m/cpu (* v v)))))))
```

Otherwise we need to turn each value into a task and `join` them:

```clj
(apply m/join vector (m/? (m/reduce conj (m/eduction (map #(m/via m/cpu (* % %))) (m/seed (range 1 11))))))
```


> flatMap is a powerful operator and helps in a lot of situations. For example, given a service that returns a Flowable, we'd like to call another service with values emitted by the first service:

```java
Flowable<Inventory> inventorySource = warehouse.getInventoryAsync();
inventorySource
    .flatMap(inventoryItem -> erp.getDemandAsync(inventoryItem.getId())
            .map(demand -> "Item " + inventoryItem.getName() + " has demand " + demand))
    .subscribe(System.out::println);
```

Basically `aFlowable.map(somethingReturningaFlowable)` would return a `Flowable<Publisher<T>>`, whereas `flatMap` "flattens" them into just `Flowable<T>`.

Assuming `getDemandAsync` returns a single value we'd model that as a task:

```clj
(def inventory (get-inventory warehouse))
(->> (m/ap (let [item (m/?> inventory), demand (m/? (get-demand erp item))] {:item item :demand demand}))
     (m/reduce (fn [_ {:keys [item demand]}] (println "Item" (:name item) "has demand" demand))))
```


> [...] given a value, invoke another service, await and continue with its result:

```java
service.apiCall()
    .flatMap(value -> service.anotherApiCall(value))
    .flatMap(next -> service.finalCall(next))
```

If these are tasks:

```clj
(m/? (m/sp (->> (api-call service) m/? (another-api-call service) m/? (final-call service) m/?)))
```

If these are flows:

```clj
(m/reduce conj (m/ap (->> (api-call service) m/?> (another-api-call service) m/?> (final-call service) m/?>)))
```


> It is often the case also that later sequences would require values from earlier mappings. This can be achieved by moving the outer flatMap into the inner parts of the previous flatMap for example:

```java
service.apiCall()
    .flatMap(value ->
        service.anotherApiCall(value)
        .flatMap(next -> service.finalCallBoth(value, next))
)
```

We'll only show with tasks since flows look very similar:

```clj
(m/? (m/sp (let [value (m/? (api-call service)), next (m/? (another-api-call service value))]
             (m/? (final-call-both service value next)))))
```


> In other scenarios, the result(s) of the first source/dataflow is irrelevant and one would like to continue with a quasi independent another source. Here, flatMap works as well. [...] Often though there is a way that is somewhat more expressive (and also lower overhead) by using Completable as the mediator and its operator andThen to resume with something else:

```java
sourceObservable
  .ignoreElements()           // returns Completable
  .andThen(someSingleSource)
  .map(v -> v.toString())
```

Here `sourceObservable` needs to be completed and only then another source can be run.

```clj
(m/? (m/sp (m/? (m/reduce (constantly nil) source-flow)) (str (m/? some-task))))
```


> Sometimes, there is an implicit data dependency between the previous sequence and the new sequence that, for some reason, was not flowing through the "regular channels".

```java
AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger();
Observable.range(1, 10)
  .doOnNext(ignored -> count.incrementAndGet())
  .ignoreElements()
  .andThen(Single.fromCallable(() -> count.get()))
  .subscribe(System.out::println);
```

```clj
