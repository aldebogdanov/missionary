# Hello task

This tutorial will help you to familiarize with the `task` abstraction, the simpler of `missionary`'s core abstractions. The other one is `flow`, and will be the topic of the next tutorial. It's especially important to build a solid mental model about it if you're coming from an imperative background.

A `task` is a value representing an action to be performed. The action eventually terminates with a status (success or failure) and a result. A pending action can be cancelled at any time, making it gracefully shutdown and terminate. A `task` can be run an arbitrary number of times. Each time the underlying action will be performed, which may produce different results.

If threads were cheap and available everywhere, we could have represented `task`s as zero-argument functions (aka thunks). Instead, we chose a purely asynchronous representation, providing efficiency and reach. You can think of `task`s as asynchronous thunks, if you will. Just keep in mind that asynchrony is a technical detail of the internal protocol, you don't need to understand it to use it.


## Hello World

Setup a dependency on the latest `missionary` release in your favorite environment and fire up a clojure REPL. Require `missionary`'s single namespace `missionary.core`, which will be aliased to `m` in the following.

```clojure
(require '[missionary.core :as m])
```

Your main tool to work with `task`s is the `sp` macro. It takes a body of clojure forms and wraps it in a `task`. The action performed by this `task` is the sequential evaluation of these forms. `sp` stands for *sequential process*.

```clojure
(def hello-world
  (m/sp (println "Hello world !")))
```

We defined the task `hello-world`, its action is to spit a message on stdout and complete with nil. To run it, we pass it to `?`. `?` performs the action of a given task and return its result.

```clojure
(m/? hello-world)
Hello world !
#_=> nil
```

Note : it won't work in a clojurescript REPL because it requires to block calling thread (more on that later).


## Sequential composition

Let's look at another task operator : `sleep`. The tasks it creates perform the action of doing nothing for a given amount of milliseconds.

```clojure
(def nap (m/sleep 1000))
(m/? nap)
#_ => nil                    ;; after 1 second
```

We can use `?` in `sp`, allowing us to sequentially compose tasks.

```clojure
(def slowmo-hello-world
  (m/sp (println "Hello")
        (m/? nap)
        (println "World")
        (m/? nap)
        (println "!")))

(m/? slowmo-hello-world)
Hello
World
!
#_=> nil                     ;; after 2 seconds
```

Note : while the semantics of `?` are the same inside and outside `sp` blocks (run a `task` and return its result), the mechanism is slightly different : the `sp` macro will detect `?` calls in its body and rewrite code in asynchronous style, such that no thread will be blocked performing `nap` (we say the process is *parked* instead of *blocked*). Consequently, this definition of `slowmo-hello-world` is perfectly legal in clojurescript.

## Parallel composition

Let's introduce concurrency. `join` is used to run multiple tasks concurrently and merge results with an arbitrary function.

```clojure
(def chatty-hello-world
  (m/join vector slowmo-hello-world slowmo-hello-world))

(m/? chatty-hello-world)
Hello
Hello
World
World
!
!
#_=> [nil nil]               ;; after 2 seconds
```

Everything went well this time, because we performed local actions, but if we were performing actual IO, we would have significant odds to encounter failures and we need to be prepared for it.

```clojure
(def unreliable-hello-world
  (m/sp (println "Hello")
        (m/? (m/sleep 500))
        (throw (ex-info "Something went wrong." {}))))

(m/? unreliable-hello-world)
Hello
;; throws after 500 ms

(def unreliable-chatty-hello-world
  (m/join vector slowmo-hello-world unreliable-hello-world))

(m/? unreliable-chatty-hello-world)
Hello
Hello
;; throws after 500 ms
```

What happened here is both tasks have been run concurrently, each has printed Hello, then the second task failed after 500 ms, then error was propagated to the join task, making it fail as well. Modeling concurrency in functional style gave us supervision for free, we don't have to program defensively, operators do what you expect by default.

In fact, under the hood, `join` reacted to the error by *cancelling* the other action, allowing it to gracefully shutdown before rethrowing the error. The cancelling signal was propagated to the `sleep` action, which deregistered itself from the scheduler and failed. Then, the sleep failure has been rethrown in the sequential process, terminating it. Only then, `join` propagated the first error.

What that means is if we want to ensure some action is done before terminating, we can use `try`/`finally` just as we do with threads.

```clojure
(def finally-hello-world
  (m/sp
    (try (println "Hello")
         (m/? nap)
         (println "World")
         (m/? nap)
         (finally
           (println "!")))))

(m/? (m/join vector unreliable-hello-world finally-hello-world))
Hello
Hello
!
;; throws after 500 ms
```

## Execution model

All operators run user-provided code immediately, in the thread allowing the computation. This scheduling strategy is the simplest possible, makes evaluation order largely deterministic with virtually no overhead, while leaving a lot of flexibility to the user for fine-grained performance tuning.

One important consequence of this design decision is that user-provided code is assumed to be inexpensive. On the JVM, blocking APIs are common, which can lead to surprising behaviors if improperly handled.

What happens if we have a service outside of our control that blocks our thread?

```clojure
(defn blocking-hello-world []
  (println "Hello")
  (Thread/sleep 500)
  (println "World"))
(time (m/? (m/join vector (m/sp (blocking-hello-world)) (m/sp (blocking-hello-world)))))
Hello
World
Hello
World
"Elapsed time: 1006.127854 msecs"
[nil nil]
```

Since `blocking-hello-world` is blocking the whole thread we're stuck. For these purposes missionary allows offloading a task on a different `java.util.concurrent.Executor` via the `m/via` macro. Missionary ships with 2 predefined executors, `m/cpu` for CPU bound tasks and `m/blk` for IO bound (BLocKing) tasks. With this new insight we can fix our previous example:

```clojure
(time (m/? (m/join vector (m/via m/blk (blocking-hello-world)) (m/via m/blk (blocking-hello-world)))))
HelloHello

World
World
"Elapsed time: 501.968621 msecs"
[nil nil]
```
